The username and password are a refernce to the 2000 movie High Fidelity, where
John Cusack is the owner of a record shop in Chicago. It's a decent movie, but Jack Black
outshines him whenever he's in the spotlight. I mean, it's Jack Black. But if you really
want to get into it, the book was definitely better.
